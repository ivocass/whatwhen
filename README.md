# Usage

-Write what you want to do and when, in your own words.
-It works best if you type first the title of your event and then the date.
Otherwise your event title might be reduced to a single word (known bug).
-Tip: no need to write "pm"
The extension assumes you mean "pm", unless you type "am".
-Tip: you can shorten words like: "tue", "aug", "tmrw", "tom"
-Tip: you can simplify "12:45" as "1245"
-Tip: to add an ending date, type both dates separated by a "-"

# Examples

-"leave at 6" <-- will be set for tomorrow if today is later than 6pm
