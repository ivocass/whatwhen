# Usage

-Write what you want to do and when, in your own words.
-It works best if you type first the title of your event and then the date.
Otherwise your event title might be reduced to a single word (known bug).
-Tip: no need to write "pm"
The extension assumes you mean "pm", unless you type "am".
